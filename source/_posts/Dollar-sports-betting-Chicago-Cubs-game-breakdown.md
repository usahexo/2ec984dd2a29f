#  Dollar sports betting: Chicago Cubs game breakdown

In this article, we are going to breakdown the Wednesday, August 23rd game between the Chicago Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cubs come into this game as -175 favorites, while the Cardinals are +155 underdogs.

Looking at the Cubs, they have some of the best hitters in all of baseball. Dexter Fowler, Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant, and Addison Russell can all mash the ball. They also have one of the best pitchers in baseball in Jake Arrieta. Arrieta has been on another level this season, and is a big reason why the Cubs are in first place in the NL Central.

The Cardinals have a good team as well, but don't have quite as much firepower as the Cubs. However, they have a couple of players who can put up some big numbers, such as Matt Carpenter and Jhonny Peralta. Carlos Martinez has also been solid for them this season on the mound.

Taking all of this into account, we think that the Cubs will win this game by a score of 5-3.

#  Learning about baseball betting odds: Chicago Cubs edition

As you might be aware, the Chicago Cubs are a professional baseball team that competes in the National League (NL) of Major League Baseball (MLB). The Cubs are based in the north-central United States, in the city of Chicago, Illinois.

The Cubs franchise was founded in 1870. The Cubs have won three World Series championships (1908, 1910, 2016), and have played in six World Series total. The Cubs are arguably one of the most popular teams in all of baseball, and their games are always heavily attended.

If you're interested in betting on baseball games, it's important to understand baseball betting odds. In this article, we'll take a look at the odds for the Chicago Cubs' upcoming game against the Miami Marlins.

As of this writing, the Cubs are favored to win by -210 odds. This means that a gambler who bets $210 on the Cubs would win $100 if they win the game. Conversely, a gambler who bets $100 on the Marlins would win $260 if they win the game.

So why are the Cubs favored? One reason is that they're a very good team. They entered Wednesday's game with a 77-44 record, which is second best in all of baseball. The Marlins, on the other hand, have a 54-68 record and are considered underdogs in this matchup. Additionally, pitching matchups can play a role in setting betting odds; Ryan Williams is starting for the Marlins while Jon Lester will start for the Cubs. Lester is considered to be one of the best pitchers in baseball, while Williams is a relatively unknown pitcher who has struggled this season.

Of course, anything can happen in baseball and upsets do happen occasionally. If you're feeling risky, you could bet on the Marlins to pull off an upset victory at +170 odds; this would mean that a gambler who bets $100 on the Marlins would win $170 if they won the game.

#  Going over the basics of sports betting: a guide for Chicago Cubs fans

The Chicago Cubs are one of the most popular baseball teams in the country. This year, they made it all the way to the World Series for the first time in 71 years. So, if you’re a fan of the Cubs, you may be wondering how to bet on their games.

In this guide, we’ll go over the basics of sports betting so that you can start placing bets on your favorite team. We’ll start with the types of bets that are available, and then we’ll move on to some tips for winning.

So, let’s get started!

# The types of bets that are available

There are three basic types of sports bets: point spread bets, money line bets, and totals bets.

Point spread betting is probably the most common type of bet. In this type of bet, one team is handicapped so that they have to win by a certain number of points in order to cover the point spread. For example, if the Cowboys are playing the Redskins and the point spread is set at 6 points, then the Cowboys would have to win by at least 7 points in order for people who bet on them to cover the point spread. If they only won by 6 points, then people who bet on them would lose their money.

Money line betting is another common type of bet. In this type of bet, you simply bet on which team will win the game outright. There is no point spread involved. So, for example, if you think that the Cubs are going to beat the Dodgers 3-2 in a game, you would place a money line bet on them (assuming that those were the odds). If they do end up winning 3-2, then you would win your bet.

Totals betting is when you wager on how many points will be scored in a game between two teams. So, for example, if you think that there are going to be a lot of runs scored in Monday night’s game between the Cubs and Dodgers, you could place a totals bet on it and hope that Over ends up being chosen as your selection. If there are indeed a lot of runs scored in that game (let’s say 9), then you would win your bet.

#  Understanding moneyline bets when it comes to the Chicago Cubs

The Chicago Cubs are one of the most popular teams in baseball, and their fan base extends far beyond the boundaries of Illinois. As a result, their games tend to draw plenty of betting action, with more money wagered on them than most other teams.

One type of bet that is especially popular when it comes to the Cubs is the moneyline bet. What is a moneyline bet? Simply put, it is a wager on who will win a game outright, without worrying about the point spread.

When it comes to betting on the Cubs, there are generally two moneylines to choose from - a "regular" line and an "extra innings" line. The regular line reflects the odds as they stand before the game starts, while the extra innings line reflects what the odds would be if the game went into extra innings.

Typically, when you bet on the Cubs at home, they will be listed as the favorite on both lines. However, this can vary depending on who they are playing. For example, if they are playing an inferior team - such as the San Diego Padres - then their odds may be shorter on the regular line but longer on the extra innings line. Conversely, if they are playing a better team - such as the Los Angeles Dodgers - their odds may be longer on the regular line but shorter on the extra innings line.

It is important to note that these lines are not always accurate predictors of how a game will play out. In fact, in some cases they can be way off. For example, if you were to bet on the Cubs at home against the Padres using the regular line, you would be betting them at -200 (meaning you would have to risk $200 to win $100). However, if you were to wait until after the game had started and use the extra innings line instead, you would find that they were actually listed as +130 (meaning you would only have to risk $130 to win $100).

Obviously, using this information to your advantage can be extremely profitable for those who know what they're doing. However, it's also important to remember that sports betting can be volatile and there is always risk involved. Make sure you only bet what you can afford to lose and always consult with a reputable sportsbook before placing any bets.
