# Where is usually closest sports betting legal Borges?

The short answer to this question is usually that the closest sports betting legal is usually in Las Vegas. However, there are exceptions to this rule, and it’s important for bettors to understand where they can and cannot place bets.

Let’s take a closer look at the states where sports betting is legal, as well as the specific laws that regulate the industry in each state.

# Where is Sports Betting Legal?

At the moment, only a handful of states have legalized sports betting. These states are Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia. In addition, there are a few other states that have passed legislation but have not yet implemented regulations.

Sports betting is currently illegal in all other states. This could change in the future now that the Supreme Court has struck down the federal ban on sports betting, but it’s unclear what will happen at this point.

For now, bettors should stick to the states where sports betting is legal. If you live in a state where sports betting is not legal, you may be able to find offshore sites that accept bets from U.S. citizens, but these sites are not regulated and there is no guarantee that your money will be safe.

# Nevada

The first state to legalize sports betting was Nevada. The state has had a well-established Sports Book industry for many years and it’s considered one of the most reputable jurisdictions in the world when it comes to gambling laws.

There are numerous Sports Books in Las Vegas, and most casinos offer betting on major sporting events. The minimum bet amount at most books is usually $5 or $10, although some high-rollers can place bets worth tens of thousands of dollars.

Nevada also allows online sports betting through licensed operators. Bettors can access these sites from their computer or mobile devices and place bets on sporting events from around the world.

# Delaware

Delaware was one of the first states to legalize online gambling, and they later expanded their laws to include sports betting as well. Bettors in Delaware can place bets at physical Sports Books as well as online through licensed operators.
The minimum bet amount at most books is $2 or $3, and there are a number of different wagers that you can place on sporting events. Like Nevada, Delaware also allows online casino games and poker tournaments.

# New Jersey
New Jersey was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against PASPA, and after winning their case they quickly passed legislation to legalize sports betting. New Jersey residents can now place bets at physical Sports Books as well as through licensed online operators. Minimum bet amounts vary depending on which book you choose, but generally range from $1-$25 per wager. In addition to traditional sporting events, New Jersey also offers betting on e-sports matches and political races.
