#  Which Tower is Closest to the Non-Smoking Casino on the Edgewater Resort?

When it comes to smoking and non-smoking casinos on the Edgewater Resort, the closest one would be the non-smoking casino. The distance between the two towers is quite significant, so it's easy to know which one is closest without having to ask anyone. 

The non-smoking casino is located in the North Tower, which is also where you'll find the main entrance and registration desk. If you're looking for a place to play some blackjack or slots without having to worry about cigarette smoke, then this is the place for you. 

Keep in mind that there are still a few smokers who venture into the non-smoking casino, but it's not as bad as it used to be. And if you really can't stand smoke, there's always the option of taking a break at one of the outdoor patios overlooking the river.

#  Which Tower offers the Best Views of the Las Vegas Strip?

There are plenty of attractions in Las Vegas, but the best views of the strip can be found from the observation decks of two towers: The Eiffel Tower at Paris Las Vegas and the Stratosphere Tower.

At 1,000 feet tall, the Stratosphere Tower offers unrivaled views of the city and its renowned landmarks. From its observation deck, visitors can see all the way to the Luxor pyramid at one end of the strip and to the flaming Mandalay Bay volcano at the other. Even more spectacular at night, the city is awash in a dazzling light show that can be best enjoyed from high above.

If you're looking for a view with a bit more elegance, then head to Paris Las Vegas and its famed Eiffel Tower replica. At 460 feet tall, it may not be as tall as its namesake in Paris, but it offers stunning 360-degree views of Sin City. On a clear day, you can even see Mount Charleston in the distance.

So which tower offers the best views of the Las Vegas Strip? It really depends on what you're looking for. If you want to experience everything from up high – including roller coasters and casinos – then go for the Stratosphere Tower. If you're looking for a more romantic setting and breathtaking scenery, opt for Eiffel Tower at Paris Las Vegas.
