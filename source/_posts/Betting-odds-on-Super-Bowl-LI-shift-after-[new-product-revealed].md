#  Nevada sports books see increased interest in new product

The Nevada sports book industry has seen a surge in interest in its new product: in-game wagering. In the past month, the amount of money wagered on in-game bets has quadrupled, with over $4 million being bet in the last week of September. In comparison, only $1 million was bet on in-game wagers in the first week of September.

This increase can be attributed to several factors. First, major sports leagues such as the NFL and MLB are starting to allow their games to be bet on in real time. In addition, many new online sportsbooks have entered the market over the past year, giving consumers more options when it comes to placing bets. Finally, there is a growing awareness of in-game betting among casual bettors, who are now starting to see it as a way to add excitement to the game and increase their chances of winning.

Nevada sports books have been offering in-game wagers for years, but they have only recently started to gain traction among bettors. This is largely due to the fact that most states do not allow this type of betting, so consumers have had little exposure to it. With more states beginning to legalize sports betting, however, we can expect to see even more interest in in-game wagers in the years ahead.

#  Bettors flock to sportsbooks to bet on new product

The world of sports betting is evolving, as bettors are now able to place wagers on eSports. This new product is attracting a great deal of interest from gamblers, as they look to capitalize on the potential profits that can be made.

eSports is a term used to describe competitive video gaming, and this industry is growing at an alarming rate. In fact, it is projected that the global audience for eSports will exceed half a billion people by 2020. This makes it an attractive option for sportsbooks, as they look to offer their customers a new way to bet on the outcomes of sporting events.

There are a variety of different eSports games that can be wagered on, including popular titles such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), League of Legends, and DOTA 2. Bettors can place bets on everything from who will win a match, to how many rounds will be played.

One reason why eSports betting is becoming so popular is the fact that the odds tend to be very favourable for the gambler. For example, in CS:GO matches, the favourite team has a 65% chance of winning, while the underdog has a 35% chance. This means that there is potential for big profits if you correctly predict the outcome of an event.

Another advantage of betting on eSports is that you don’t need to have any expert knowledge about the games in order to make informed predictions. All you need to do is study the form guides and odds offered by sportsbooks, and then make your bets accordingly.

If you’re looking for an exciting new way to bet on sports, then eSports could be just what you’re looking for. With ever-growing audiences and extremely favourable odds, there’s plenty of potential profits to be made here!
