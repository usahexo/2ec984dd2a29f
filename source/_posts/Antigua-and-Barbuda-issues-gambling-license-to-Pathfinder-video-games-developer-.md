#  Antigua and Barbuda issues gambling license to Pathfinder video games developer 

Pathfinder, a video games developer, has been granted a gambling license by the government of Antigua and Barbuda. This will allow the company to offer its products to online casinos and other gambling platforms.

The CEO of Pathfinder, Alessandro Fried, said that the company is excited to launch its products in the regulated market. He added that the license will help them expand their reach to new markets.

Pathfinder is a four-year-old company that launched its first game, Slotomania, in 2014. The company has since released several other games, including Pyramid Solitaire Saga and FarmVille: Tropic Escape. It has also partnered with numerous casino operators, including LeoVegas and Mr Green.

Antigua and Barbuda is one of the most popular gambling jurisdictions in the world. The country has long been known for its liberal stance on gambling, and it has developed a well-regulated gaming industry.

The government of Antigua and Barbuda has welcomed Pathfinder's arrival in the country. John Saldivar, the Minister of National Security, said that the company's products will be a welcome addition to the local market. He added that the government looks forward to working with Pathfinder to grow the gaming industry in Antigua and Barbuda.

#  Pathfinder Games expanding into the online gambling market 

Pathfinder Games, a popular online gambling company, is expanding its services into the online casino market. The company has been in the business of online gambling for many years, and has seen success in its markets. Pathfinder Games plans to use its experience and knowledge to make a name for itself in the casino market.

The company has already released a few casino games, and plans to expand its library in the coming months. It also intends to offer bonuses and promotions to players in order to attract them to its site. In addition, Pathfinder Games is working on developing a mobile app that will allow players to access their casino account from anywhere.

The move into the casino market comes as no surprise; online gambling is a growing industry, and Pathfinder Games wants to make sure it capitalize on this growth. The company is confident that it can be successful in this new venture, and looks forward to bringing its games to players all around the world.

#  Antigua and Barbuda licensed Pathfinder Games to offer live dealer casino games 

The government of Antigua and Barbuda has entered into an agreement with Pathfinder Games to offer live dealer casino games from the twin-island nation. The games will be available to players around the world, with the exception of residents of the United States.

Pathfinder Games is a subsidiary of the Malta-based firm Casino Gaming Ventures. The company operates a number of online casinos, including CasinoEuro, Betsson, and Betsafe.

“We are very excited about this new venture,” said Pathfinder Games CEO Alan Green. “Our team has many years of experience in the iGaming industry and we are looking forward to offering our players an exciting live dealer experience.”

The agreement between Antigua and Barbuda and Pathfinder Games allows the former to offer a number of live dealer games, including blackjack, baccarat, and roulette. In addition, the deal allows Antigua and Barbuda to offer a number of popular slot games, including Starburst and Gonzo’s Quest.

The agreement is seen as a major coup for Antigua and Barbuda, which is seeking to attract more tourists to its shores. In recent years, the twin-island nation has seen its tourism sector suffer due to increased competition from other Caribbean destinations.

Antigua and Barbuda is not the only country looking to offer live dealer casino games. Earlier this year, Gibraltar signed an agreement with Evolution Gaming to offer similar services from its jurisdiction.

#  Pathfinders making their way into the global gambling market with Antigua and Barbuda license 

Pathfinders Interactive Limited, a Maltese company, has secured a license from the government of Antigua and Barbuda to offer online gambling services. The company plans to use the license to offer casino games, sports betting, and poker to customers around the world.

This is not Pathfinders’ first foray into the gambling market. The company has been offering sports betting services since 2013 and currently operates in over 30 countries. With the new Antigua and Barbuda license, Pathfinders plans to expand its operations further into Europe and North America.

The company’s CEO, Julian Drachman, is optimistic about the future of the business. “The gambling industry is growing rapidly and we are well-positioned to take advantage of this growth. Our experience in the industry and our commitment to providing high-quality products and services will help us to grow our customer base and increase our market share.”

Pathfinders is not alone in its ambitions for global expansion. Several other companies have obtained licenses from Antigua and Barbuda in recent months, including Bet365, Paddy Power Betfair, and 888 Holdings. This suggests that the government of Antigua and Barbuda is eager to attract foreign investment as it looks to diversify its economy away from tourism.
