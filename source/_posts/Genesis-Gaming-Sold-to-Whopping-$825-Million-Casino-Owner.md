Genesis Gaming was founded in 2006 and has become one of the leading providers of slot games for the online casino market. The company’s clients include some of the biggest brands in the business, including LeoVegas, Mr Green, and William Hill.

The deal is said to be worth millions of pounds and will see the new owners take a majority stake in the company. Existing shareholders will retain a minority stake in Genesis Gaming.

It’s not clear what this sale will mean for the future of Genesis Gaming. However, industry experts expect that the new owners will move to expand the company’s operations into new markets, such as Asia.

#  Casino Firm Genesis Gaming Sold to US Firm 

The Canadian casino game developer, Genesis Gaming, has been acquired by an American gaming company. The deal is reported to be worth around $60 million CAD and will see Genesis Gaming merge with its new owner.

Genesis Gaming is a relatively small but well-known casino game developer. Headquartered in Vancouver, the company has created games for land-based and online casinos across the world. Some of its more popular titles include "Dragon’s Temple", "Inca Gold II" and "Robo Smash".

The new owner is reportedly the US gaming company Golden Nugget LLC. The Nevada-based company operates a chain of land-based casinos as well as an online gambling platform.

According to Cameron Clayton, CEO of Golden Nugget LLC, the purchase of Genesis Gaming is all about growth. "This acquisition accelerates our global expansion strategy and provides us with an immediate footprint in the attractive Canadian market," he said in a statement.
