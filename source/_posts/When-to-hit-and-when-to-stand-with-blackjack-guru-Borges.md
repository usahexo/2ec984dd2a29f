#  When to hit and when to stand with blackjack guru Borges

This is a look at the blackjack wisdom of the father of probability, Jorge Luis Borges.

When most people think of blackjack, they think of card counting. While card counting is a viable strategy, it's not the only one. In some cases, basic strategy alone can be enough to give you an edge over the casino. How do you know when to use basic strategy and when to bust out the counting? Let's take a look at what Borges has to say about it all.

According to Borges, there are three times when basic strategy trumps card counting: when you're playing multiple hands, when the deck is rich in high cards, and when the dealer stands on soft 17.

When playing multiple hands, basic strategy will give you a better chance of winning than counting cards. This is because you can't keep track of as many cards when you're playing more than one hand at a time. Basic strategy takes this into account and gives you optimal plays for each hand you're holding.

When the deck is rich in high cards, card counting becomes less important. With more high cards in the deck, the odds tilt in favor of the player, making card counting less effective. In these situations, sticking with basic strategy is your best bet.

Finally, when the dealer stands on soft 17, basic strategy again outperforms card counting. This is because dealers with this rule tend to bust more often than those who don't stand on soft 17. By using basic strategy in these situations, you can take advantage of the dealer's mistakes and increase your chances of winning.

#  How to play blackjack like a pro with help from Borges

There are a few things that you can do to blackjack like a pro. Playing by the right strategy is essential, as is having a positive mindset. Being able to read your opponents is also key, as well as knowing when to walk away from the table.

One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is to always use the right strategy. This involves making the correct decisions about when to hit, stand, double down or split your cards. You can find plenty of resources online which will help you learn how to play blackjack using the right strategy for your odds.

Another important factor in becoming a pro at blackjack is having a positive mindset. It’s easy to get frustrated if you’re not winning every hand, but it’s important to stay positive and focus on the long game. Remember, even the best players lose sometimes – it’s part of the game!

Being able to read your opponents is also key in blackjack. If you can figure out what they’re holding and what they might be trying to do, you can make more informed choices about how to play your cards. Keep an eye on their betting patterns and body language, and try to get an idea of what they might have in their hand.

Finally, it’s also important to know when to walk away from the table. If you start losing money regularly or if you start feeling frustrated or angry, it might be time to take a break from the game. Losing money can be frustrating, but it’s important not to let emotions affect your decision-making skills. There’s always another day at the casino!

#  When to split and when to surrender with blackjack tips from Borges

In any casino game, the key to success is making the most advantageous decisions possible. This is particularly true when playing blackjack, where a small edge can mean the difference between significant profits and losses.

Knowing when to surrender and when to split can be the difference between winning and losing in blackjack. Here are some tips from Borges on when to make these moves:

# When to surrender

When should you surrender in blackjack? Generally, you should surrender when your chances of winning are low and the potential payout is not worth the risk. For example, if you have a hard 10 against a dealer's Ace, it is generally not worth risking losing your bet in order to try and get a win. In this case, it would be better to surrender and cut your losses.

However, there are times when it makes sense to risk a surrendered hand in order to increase your chances of winning. For example, if you have an Ace and a nine (A-9), you may want to try and hit rather than surrendering since there is still a good chance of getting another ten (10-J-Q-K).

It's important to remember that each situation is unique, so always use your best judgement when deciding whether or not to surrender.

# When to split

When should you split in blackjack? As with surrendering, there is no one definitive answer for this question. However, there are some general guidelines that you can follow:

* Split pairs of 2s through 8s against any dealer upcard.
The exception to this rule is if the dealer has an Ace upcard – in this case, hit instead of splitting those pairs.
* Split Aces against any dealer upcard except an Ace. If the dealer has an Ace upcard, hit instead of splitting Aces. 

 * Split Tens only against a dealer's 2 through 9 card upcards. Never split Tens against a 10 or Ace upcard. 

Following these basic guidelines can help you make more advantageous decisions while playing blackjack and improve your chances of winning.

#  Blackjack secrets from the master - Borges knows when to hit and stand

The world-renowned Argentinian writer, Jorge Luis Borges, revealed some of his blackjack secrets in a 1972 interview.

Borges stated that the secret to blackjack success is to know when to hit and when to stand. Hitting is when you take another card in order to get closer to 21. Standing is when you decide not to hit any more cards and instead keep the total that you have.

Borges also said that it is important to learn from your mistakes. If you lose money at blackjack, analyze why you lost and make changes accordingly. Remember, there is no such thing as a perfect strategy – even Borges himself has lost money playing blackjack!

So what are you waiting for? Start practicing your blackjack skills using Borges’ advice and see if you can become as successful as the master himself!

#  How to beat the casino at blackjack with Borges

If you're looking to beat the casino at blackjack, you'll need to study up on some smart strategies. Luckily, with the help of Jorge Luis Borges, you can gain a competitive edge over the house.

In his 1941 essay "The Aleph," Borges discusses a mathematical principle that can be used to beat the dealer at blackjack. The principle is called the "Law of Large Numbers" and it states that as the number of trials increases, the average value of the results will approach the theoretical value.

For example, let's say you flip a coin 100 times. The average value of the results will be 50 heads and 50 tails. In other words, if you keep flipping coins long enough, the percentage of heads will approach 50/50. This same principle can be applied to blackjack by keeping track of how many times you've won and lost against the dealer.

By doing this, you'll eventually establish a winning streak against the house. As Borges wisely puts it: "In time, Licurgo's laws lead not only to equilibrium but to victory."
