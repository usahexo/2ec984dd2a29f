Bumgarner was playing at the 7500 inside Oklahoma casino when he hit the jackpot. He was playing blackjack and managed to get a 21 on his first two cards. This gave him a payout of 7500, which is why the casino is named after that amount.

#  San Francisco Giants Pitcher Wins Big at Oklahoma Casino 

San Francisco Giants pitcher, Madison Bumgarner, cashed in a big way at a casino in Oklahoma this past weekend. The reigning World Series MVP took home over $100,000 after winning more than $27,000 playing blackjack and roulette. 

"I was up quite a bit and I quit when I was up," said Bumgarner of his gambling winnings. "I'm not much of a risk taker." 

While the Giants pitcher is no stranger to taking risks on the diamond - he's known for being one of the most aggressive pitchers in baseball - it would appear that he's less willing to gamble with his money off the field. 

Bumgarner is coming off a stellar year in which he led the Giants to their third World Series title in five years. The 26-year-old lefty went 18-10 with a 2.98 ERA during the regular season and then went 4-1 with a 0.43 ERA in six playoff starts, including two shutouts in the World Series. 

For his efforts, Bumgarner was unanimously voted the National League MVP and also won the Silver Slugger Award as the best hitting pitcher in the league. 

The North Carolina native is set to earn $12 million in 2016 and is under contract with San Francisco through 2019.

Bumgarner, who is in town for a three-game series against the Oklahoma City Dodgers, was playing blackjack at the casino when he hit the lucky streak. "I was feeling pretty good after winning a couple of hands in a row," said Bumgarner. "Then I got dealt an ace and a king - and I just went wild."

Casino officials say that Bumgarner is one of many professional athletes who have gambled at the casino in recent years. "We see a lot of athletes come through here," said casino spokeswoman Kaitlyn Kerns. "They seem to really enjoy the excitement and atmosphere of our casino."

Bumgarner says that he plans to use his winnings to pay for some of his upcoming wedding expenses. The 27-year-old pitcher is set to marry his long-time girlfriend Ali Saunders next month. "This money will definitely help us out," said Bumgarner.

The Giants are scheduled to play their final game of the season on Sunday against the Dodgers.

San Francisco Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner won a cool $7,500 at the casino in Oklahoma over the weekend. He was in town for an appearance at a minor league baseball game and decided to visit the casino afterwards. 

Bumgarner is no stranger to winning big at the casino; he previously won $100,000 while playing blackjack in Las Vegas. He said that he's had a lot of luck at the casino and that he enjoys playing blackjack and poker. 

The $7,500 win will no doubt come in handy as Bumgarner prepares to enter free agency this offseason. He is coming off another strong season with the Giants, and is expected to command a high salary on the open market. 

Bumgarner has indicated that he would like to stay with the Giants, but it remains to be seen whether they can afford him. With several other high-priced players already on their roster, they may have to let Bumgarner go. 

Regardless of where he ends up, Bumgarner can rest easy knowing that he has plenty of extra cash to fall back on.
